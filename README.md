## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass (Preprocessor) for CSS [https://sass-lang.com/]
- Scss syntax
- Javascript for interactivity

### What I learned

I wanted to do this challenge as a workout about the layout, as it was a fairly simple and fast process, using techniques that I now use in practically all challenges, so overall I didn't find any difficulties.
Simple exercise but useful ;)

### Continued development

In the near future I always want to continue to improve on the Javascript side in view of learning a framework like React, always continuing to master the layout techniques.
